# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project maintains independent sequential versions (`v1`, `v2`, `v3`...):
- **Marketplace** (`metadata.version` in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)
- **Each plugin** (`version` in `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`)

Versions are bumped automatically by CI on merge to main.
